## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HARIHARANS24/multi-mode-movie-recommender-python.git
   cd multi-mode-movie-recommender-python
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate    # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash

   ```

## 💻 Usage

### 1. Command Line Interface (CLI)
Run the CLI tool to get movie recommendations directly in your terminal:
```bash
python cli.py --movie "The Matrix" --method content
```

Options for `--method`:
- `content` — content-based filtering
- `collaborative` — collaborative filtering
- `hybrid` — combined approach

### 2. Flask Web Application
Start the Flask server:
```bash
python web_flask/app.py
```
Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to use the web interface.

### 3. Streamlit Interactive App
Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run web_streamlit/app.py
```
A browser window will open with a sleek interactive UI for movie recommendations.

## 📊 Data
Place your `movies.csv` file inside the `data/` folder. The CSV should contain:
- Movie titles
- Overviews
- Genres
- User ratings (for collaborative filtering)
- Additional metadata
